= Tailor hacks for better darcs -> git conversion

a look at
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bzr/bzr-fastimport/trunk/files/head%3A/exporters/darcs/[darcs-fast-export].

The tailor subdir is a modified version of tailor, it contains several ugly
hacks to work around problems during a darcs to git conversion. I plan to
create proper fixs for these issues and submit them to upstream. Basically
these hacks allowed me to convert a repo with more than 25.000 (relatively
small, but containing conflicts) patches properly and in less than 8 hours (or
so).

The tests subdir contains repos with typical problems, they can be used later
for proper bugfixes.

The tailor-wrap repo is the 'main' repo, you should first get that one. It
contains a wrapper for both darcs and git to work around several problems and
to speed up the conversion. Read the `INSTALL` file in that repo on how to
proceed.
